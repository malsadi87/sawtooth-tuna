* Move all external config to docker env config

* Authentication:
- Password validation
- Email verification
- Sign out and other controller endpoints return null
- I agree all statements in Terms of service is not required for API request
- GUI freezes on "user exists" error 500

* TP
- Can overwrite values
- Can create objects with conflicting start and end times
- Requests for single objects (?objectId=X) returns all object regardless if the object exists or not.
- Latitudes and longitudes are appended trailing zeros. Is this expected?
