* Move all external config to docker env config

* Authentication:
- Password validation
- Email verification
- Sign out and other controller endpoints return null
- I agree all statements in Terms of service is not required for API request
- GUI freezes on "user exists" error 500

* TP
- Can overwrite values
- Can create objects with conflicting start and end times
- Many potential datetime issues across entities: Such as the catch time before the trip departure time.
- Requests for single objects (?objectId=X) returns all object regardless if the object exists or not.
- Latitudes and longitudes are appended trailing zeros. Is this expected?
- I dont understand if the relations for pallets are correct. There is a productNum there, but it does not relate to productId or any product entity.
- Some entities with relationships with other entities does not have foreign key contraints.
